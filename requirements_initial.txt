I want to create a full-stack proof-of-concept banking app. The frontend should be vue.js and the backend should be .NET. I want all code throughout to be scalable, modular, and DRY as much possible. There should be robust validation for both the frontend and backend.

For the backend, I want to use .NET/C#. I want the project strucuture to represent CLEAN architecture principles.

For managing the database, I want to use Postgres.

I want the frontend to have a clean, component-based structure with minimal/simple styling.
